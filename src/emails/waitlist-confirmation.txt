YOUR RELATIONSHIP MEMORY ENGINE IS WAITING

Hi {{firstName}},

Thank you for securing your spot on the Glim waitlist. You've made a crucial first step toward never losing another opportunity because of forgotten context.

Your brain was never meant to be a CRM. Glim is.

While you wait for your access, here's what you can look forward to:

* Turn messy voice reflections into relationship momentum
* Capture nuance and context that traditional CRMs can't
* Translate memory into authentic actions that close deals
* Extend the monetization window of every relationship
* Convert one-time meetings into recurring opportunities

Your network isn't dying. It's fading. And every day, you're missing opportunities you don't even realize exist.

Glim will notify you as soon as your access is ready. The people you're forgetting will thank you.

Best regards,
The Glim Team
