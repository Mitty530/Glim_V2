This isn’t just positioning advice. This is how Glim becomes the inevitable choice in its market.

STEP 1: THE TRUTH ABOUT THE EXISTING CATEGORY

You are not in the CRM category.

That category is bloated, mature, commoditized, and utterly indifferent to nuance. Every player is locked in a losing war of “features vs features” and “better UX” arguments.

And it’s why most SaaS tools bleed out in a feature comparison knife fight.

Glim’s first move is to hijack existing intent and reroute it to a new buying frame.

WHAT IS GLIM, REALLY?

It’s not a CRM.

It’s not a contact manager.

It’s not “notes with AI.”

Those are old containers that trap you in the minds of prospects as “just another tool.”

So what is it?

Glim is an AI Relationship Memory Engine.

That’s the Category Name.

Let’s backcast and frame the market:

OLD REALITY (what people think they need)

A CRM to log notes and remind them to follow up
A task manager to ping them later
A spreadsheet to remember where they met someone
These are all “solutions” created in an era where the assumption was: You, the human, are responsible for remembering everything.

NEW TRUTH (category POV)

“The human brain was never meant to be a CRM.”

People don’t forget because they’re lazy. They forget because relationship memory is unstructured, emotional, and context-rich, not bullet points.

Glim intercepts that moment of forgetfulness and converts it into continuity.

Just finished a coffee chat? Speak into Glim, and it turns your messy reflection into relationship momentum.

Glim doesn’t just help you remember. It helps you reconnect, authentically, intelligently, and at scale.

WHO IS THIS FOR?

Forget “entrepreneurs” or “networkers.”

Your People:

Relationship-heavy professionals (sales, fundraisers, recruiters, investors)
With high-value deals and high-context interactions
Who feel guilt or loss when a connection fades
This is a psychographic, not just a demographic.

They don’t want a CRM. They want to stop losing opportunities because of human bandwidth.

THE CORE FRUSTRATION (EMOTIONAL AWARENESS BRIDGE)

“I keep meeting great people. But two weeks later, I forget what made that moment meaningful. Then it’s awkward. So I don’t follow up at all.”

This is not a “productivity problem.”

This is a regret problem.

And that’s your leverage.

CATEGORY NAME: AI RELATIONSHIP MEMORY ENGINE

It does what a CRM can’t:

Captures nuance
Translates memory into action
Builds authentic connection through automation
The AI isn’t there to store info, it’s there to make you look like a world-class relationship builder without lifting a finger.

FRAME THE CATEGORY. THEN CLAIM IT.

Glim is the world’s first AI Relationship Memory Engine.

CRMs were designed for pipeline tracking.

Glim was designed for people tracking, emotions, goals, jokes, birthdays, dreams, context.

And guess what closes deals? Context.

FROM PRODUCT TO ECONOMICS

Now, apply Competing on Economics​.

Right now, the value of a relationship decays the moment it ends.

Glim extends the monetization window of relationships.

Instead of one call = one opportunity, Glim turns one call = recurring reactivation potential, trust compounding, inbound warm intros.

It is an economic multiplier for human connection.

SIMPLE STRATEGY​

Here’s how you build dominance:

Information

Educate the market on the cost of forgotten follow-ups. Frame the POV:

“The brain isn’t a CRM”
“You don’t need a better system, you need a memory engine”
“Missed moments cost you money”
Ads

Targeted ads with built on status loss and missed opportunity. Not “see how Glim works” but “see how you’re bleeding ROI from your network.”

Ad structure. Cold open with:

“You’re forgetting people that could change your business. You just don’t know it yet.”

Real examples. Demo how messy voice memos become thoughtful re-intros. Let your early adopters evangelize with “I never realized how much I was forgetting.”

Hmm…

Glim isn’t a tool. It’s a competitive advantage.
Stop selling “CRM with AI.” Start selling relationship ROI on autopilot.
Position it as a category king by naming and framing a new category.
Go after emotional pain, the shame of forgetting, the loss of rapport, the silent cost of disconnection.
Charge a premium. This isn’t SaaS. This is insurance for your most valuable asset: your network.
If Glim captures this positioning, the outcome is inevitable.

You won’t be another CRM.

You’ll be the Category Queen of AI-Powered Relationship Memory.

Stage 2
Conversion-driven truth designed to grab wallets and destroy alternatives.

1. WHO THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR (NOT WHO YOU THINK)

This isn’t for “networkers”.

That’s lazy thinking.

This is for killers.

The people who are in the business of knowing people, and monetizing that knowledge:

High-ticket closers
Fundraisers with million-dollar targets
Recruiters filling $200K roles
Founders raising from VCs who ghost
Biz dev hitters who get paid to “know a guy”
These people don’t need a better note-taking tool.

They need leverage on the forgotten conversation.

Because deals don’t die in meetings. They die in the gaps between them.

2. THE EMOTIONAL BLEED POINT (THIS IS WHAT SELLS)

You’re not selling AI.

You’re not selling features.

You’re selling the pain of losing a relationship you almost converted.

Glim exists to eliminate the shame of forgetting:

“You had that great chat. You even said you’d follow up. But now you can’t remember what made it special. So you don’t follow up at all.”

This is where your customer lives.

Right now.

Frustrated, annoyed, pissed off at themselves for being sloppy with their most valuable asset, their network.

That’s your foot in the door. Not “smart contact cards.”

3. REMOVE SKEPTICISM

Let’s call it what it is:

“Most CRMs are glorified spreadsheets that nobody uses.”

People install CRMs with the intention of being organized. Then they never log in.

Why?

Because entering data is a chore. Following up feels fake. And everything about the tool screams corporate beige.

Glim doesn’t “organize your contacts.”

It weaponizes your memory.

You say, “met Sarah, she likes hiking, looking for analytics platform,” and Glim turns that into a follow-up with context that closes.

It doesn’t save notes.

It saves deals.

4. THE FLIP, WHO THIS IS NOT FOR

This is not for:

People who love admin
People who still use Excel as a CRM
Anyone who brags about “zero inbox”
If you enjoy typing notes, setting manual reminders, and juggling tabs… Glim is overkill.

But if you’re drowning in convos and losing money from forgetting follow-ups, Glim isn’t a luxury.

It’s a lifesaver.

5. THE HERO’S JOURNEY (SOCIAL PROOF, NOT TESTIMONIALS)

Tell this story in your ads:

“Before Glim, I was forgetting names two days after the event. I'd have amazing meetings and never follow up because I couldn’t recall what made them matter. I looked unprofessional. Deals slipped. Referrals dried up.

Now, I just talk. Glim turns my voice note into a personalized follow-up I can send with one click. It’s like my brain finally got a CRM... without needing to think.”

That’s not a “review.”

That’s a mirror your prospect looks into and says, “Holy sh*, that’s me.”*

6. POSITIONING THAT CONVERTS (THE CORE MESSAGE)

“CRMs are for pipelines. Glim is for people.”

Boom.

You just nuked 99% of your “competition” in one sentence.

Now follow it up with this:

“Glim captures what made the conversation real, so you can follow up with context, and close with confidence.”

You just sold continuity. You sold momentum. You sold money.

7. PSYCHOLOGY TRIGGERS THAT SHOULD BE EVERYWHERE

Status loss: “You’re forgetting the people who could’ve changed your business.”
Fear of regret: “Every week you wait is another missed deal you’ll never even realize you lost.”
Aspirational identity: “The best closers don’t remember everything. They just never drop the ball.”
Future pacing: “Imagine a world where every interaction ends with the perfect follow-up. That’s Glim.”
This is how you break defense shields. This is how you write checks with your offer.

8. URGENT CTA THAT GETS CLICKS (AND BUY-INS)

“Your network isn’t dying. It’s fading.

You’ve got 14 days before that investor forgets you. 3 days before that warm intro goes cold. 1 chance to follow up with that $300K deal.

Let Glim handle the memory, so you can handle the money.

Join the waitlist. Lock your edge.”

Hmm…

Glim is sitting on a goldmine of human capital.

The offer is strong.

The pain is real.

But right now? It’s still selling like it’s afraid of being great.

Fix that.

Kill soft language
Lead with loss
Elevate the identity
Hammer emotional bleed
Sell the consequence of inaction
Wrap it all in status, shame, and certainty
Glim shouldn’t feel like “smart contact cards.”

It should feel like a sixth sense for money-making conversations.

“Cool theory. Now let’s sell it.”

The FIRST gave you the map. The SECOND one gave you the bullets.

Glim is a new category, but we’re not here to win branding awards. We’re here to pull money from memory loss.

So here’s how you fuse both:

1. OWN THE FRAME, CREATE THE CATEGORY AND DESTROY THE CURRENT CONVERSATION

“Glim isn’t a CRM. It’s an AI Relationship Memory Engine.”

Name it, frame it, claim it
Kills the existing context of “CRMs” dead in one line

You’re not entering a crowded market.

You’re creating a new behavior: voice-in → money-out.

You’ve named the enemy (CRMs, spreadsheets, human forgetfulness) and introduced the better model, automated, context-rich, effortless reconnection.

That’s calling everything

“Making everything else irrelevant.”

2. LEAD WITH EMOTIONAL BLEED, THEN REFRAME WITH LOGIC

“Frame the problem, own the solution.”

“Show them their shame. Then give them status.”

Hook:

“You’re not short on contacts. You’re short on continuity.”

Then dig the knife:

“You meet someone. You vibe. You share stories. Then it’s gone.

Because you were ‘too busy’ to write it down.

So you forget the details, and now following up feels awkward.

Meanwhile, the deal you could’ve closed? The intro they could’ve made? Dead.”

Now flip it:

“Glim gives you back your momentum. The meeting ends. You talk. Glim turns your memory into money.”

Emotional bridge first. Logic later. Always.

3. DESIRE + MATH + FUTURE = THE CLOSE

Here’s how you would stack the conversion triggers after setting the category:

“The best closers don’t have better memory. They have better systems.

And the best systems do the follow-up for them.

Glim doesn’t help you remember names.

It helps you remember why they matter, so you never miss the moment again.”

Then drop the math:

“You close 3 extra deals this year because of a better follow-up. That’s $90K, $150K, maybe more.

Glim costs less than your Netflix subscription.

You tell me: which one has better ROI?”

Justify desire with math. Frame the emotional cost. Sell the inevitability.

4. (FROM → TO) IN HIGH-CONVERSION LANGUAGE

FROM: “Missed follow-ups, awkward re-intros, forgotten gold” TO: “Every call becomes compounding connection and capital”

Don’t say “organize your network.”

Say:

“Glim turns your casual chats into compounding leverage.”

Or:

“From coffee chats to capital raised. Glim makes it automatic.”

This is where the hybrid magic happens, Stage one crafts the shift, Stage two  turns it into conversion copy.

5. YOUR CTA IS A TEST OF STATUS

Status-based consequence.

“Every day you wait, someone else is remembering better than you.

Their follow-ups are sharp. Yours are forgotten.

They’re closing the deal that could’ve been yours.”

Then drop the hammer:

“Your network is only as strong as your last follow-up.

Glim makes sure it’s never the last.”

CTA:
Join the waitlist. Or keep bleeding deals.

THE STRATEGY: Pre-Monetized Status Loops

No ad budget? No problem.

Skip straight to growth loops that create status, cashflow, and psychological lock-in before the product even drops.

Here’s the full go-strategy:

STEP 1: Tiered Waitlist with Skin-in-the-Game Pricing

“Your memory is costing you deals.
The waitlist is open, but only for those serious enough to bet on it.”

Then drop this:

Choose your level of seriousness:

$0.99 – Observer: “Curious to see it”
$1.99 – Insider: “I need this”
$5.99 – Operator: “I know this prints money”
Every tier unlocks different early access, feature control, or private sessions with Glim’s team. Optional: let higher tiers vote on features.

Why it works:

Filters tire-kickers
Frames value from day one
Creates a micro-investment bias (“I paid for this. I’m using it.”)
Starts training people to expect to pay for value
Even better? Drop a line like:

“People will complain there’s a price to join the waitlist.
Those are the people who never follow up anyway.”

Now you're triggering ego, status, and FOMO in one move.

STEP 2: Memory Drop Campaigns (Organic Growth Loop)

You don’t market the product.

You market the pain of forgetfulness.

Here’s the move:

Launch a simple campaign called:

“The One I Forgot”

People post the story of a person they met, forgot to follow up with, and what it cost them.

Could be a client. A partner. A job. A date.

Structure:

Who it was
What happened
What they forgot
What they missed out on
CTA: “Never forget the next one. Join Glim’s waitlist.”

Every story is a growth node.
Every post reminds someone of their forgotten deal.
Every comment becomes a viral thread.

Bonus: Feature the best stories on a “Wall of Regret” and send winners Glim access.

STEP 3: Invite-Only Momentum Loop

When Glim opens, do not go wide.

You use controlled scarcity with built-in referrals:

Each early user gets 2 invites
Each invite bumps them higher in the priority queue
But access isn’t free, it’s unlocked by contributing
Examples:

Submit 1 voice note use case = 1 invite
Share a contact card demo = 1 invite
Post your “One I Forgot” = 1 invite
You’re not rewarding attention. You’re rewarding momentum.

STEP 4: Soft Launch as Status Layer

The real unlock?

Turn Glim into a social flex for serious operators.

Use lines like:

“Most people remember names.
Operators remember context.”

Or:

“You’re not networking. You’re forgetting.”

Let the early users brag about their Glim experience the way founders brag about Notion docs or founders bragged about Superhuman invites.

People don’t just use Glim. They use it to signal:

I’m connected
I follow up
I close loops
That’s the network effect. Not built on tech. Built on ego.

Hmm…

“No budget? Good.
Ad money can’t buy momentum.
But story, scarcity, and ego will.”

Here’s what you just built:

Pre-revenue monetization
Referral loops tied to contribution
Viral stories seeded in pain
Status-layered exclusivity
And demand with no paid traffic
All before launch.

This isn’t a campaign.
This is a category introduction sequence that builds itself.

Blog Post Ideas

You’re not launching a blog. You’re building a content weapon that seeds virality, activates growth loops, fuels word-of-mouth, and makes people pay just to get in line.

Here are 11 blog posts that double as social content + growth loops + list builders + psychological landmines for Glim, each one strategically designed to get circulated, quoted, and acted on.

1. The Deals You Don’t Know You Lost

Hook: The most expensive losses don’t come from rejection. They come from forgetfulness.

Loop: “What’s your follow-up failure? Post it. Tag @glim.”

Power Stack:

Each blog post:

Ends with a pay-to-join CTA (with tiered pricing)
Encourages a viral comment action or content submission
Promotes user-generated content (UGC)
Includes a download, quiz, or swipe as a lead magnet or incentive
What You’re Actually Building:

A virality loop (posts → shares → UGC → waitlist growth)
A status loop (only paid waitlist users get access to contribute stories/templates/votes)
A referral loop (users share posts, get bumped up waitlist priority)
BLOG POST STRUCTURE

Forget intros. Forget SEO for now. Here’s the anatomy of a high-performing blog post:

1. Cold Open that Punches the Ego

No warm-up. No throat clearing.
You start with a hard truth or an emotional bleed:

“You didn’t lose the deal on the call.
You lost it 12 days later when you forgot to follow up.”

Or:

“Your CRM isn’t saving deals. It’s hiding your failures.”

This instantly qualifies the reader. If they flinch, they stay. If they bounce, they were never buying anyway.

2. Expose the Hidden Enemy

Now you name the invisible problem:

“Everyone thinks they need better tools.
What they need is a system that eliminates human error.”

You’re not writing about “note-taking.”
You’re revealing the emotional and financial cost of forgetfulness.

3. Agitate with Real Consequences

Don’t  just describe pain. Give it numbers and names:

“You met Sarah at SaaStr.
You had a great chat.
You were supposed to follow up.
You didn’t.
That was a $120K deal.
Now she’s onboarding with your competitor.”

Then hit with:

“You didn’t lose it on performance.
You lost it on memory.”

4. Introduce the “Weapon”

Now Glim enters, not as a product, but as a solution to status loss.

“Glim isn’t a CRM. It’s an AI relationship memory engine.
The job isn’t to help you organize.
It’s to make sure you never forget what makes money.”

This is not a product pitch. It’s a status restoration device.

5. Give a Tactical Visual or Story

Drop a voice note example.
Show a before-and-after “smart contact card.”
Walk through a missed opportunity and reverse-engineer it with Glim.

This is your proof loop.
Let them see themselves using it before you ask for action.

6. Social Call-to-Action (Growth Loop Trigger)

End with a non-obvious CTA that creates shareable behavior:

“What’s your most painful follow-up miss?
Post it. Tag @glim. We’ll feature the best ones, and hook you up with early access.”

Or:

“Want a memory engine that never forgets what closes?
Pay to join the waitlist.
Or keep ghosting the people who would’ve changed your business.”

7. Optional: Create Status Tension

Turn the post into a litmus test for who gets it and who doesn’t.

“Some people will read this and say ‘cool blog.’
Others will realize this is the weapon they’ve been missing.
Only one of those people is about to dominate their category.”

This filters your readers by seriousness, and makes the right ones act.

Just status violation, emotional clarity, sharp diagnosis, and the only path to redemption: Glim.

Hmm…

Don’t write blog posts.
Write traps.
Write spotlights that show people their failure.
Then hand them the weapon that ends it.

You’ve got something rare.

The bones are there.
The angle is fresh.
The potential is real.

But right now?

You’re still talking like the founder of a promising tool, not the leader of a dominant movement.

You don’t need more clever.
You need control.

Because clever doesn’t scale.
Category kings do.

What you’re sitting on isn’t missing product.
It’s missing power.

That teardown? That was the easy part.
The real game is building a monetization engine that makes your positioning inevitable, your messaging impossible to ignore, and your conversions compound without lifting a finger.

Right now?

You’ve got a Ferrari engine...
Stuck in a Prius funnel.

But don’t confuse momentum with movement.

One gets attention.
The other gets paid.

Your call.
